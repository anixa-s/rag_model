<h1> RAG Model for Efficient PDF Information Retrieval </h1>
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to extract and answer questions from long PDF documents, specifically targeted at helping students and educators quickly sift through dense International Baccalaureate (IB) material. Instead of spending hours skimming through IB study guides, past papers, or handbooks, this tool lets you ask natural-language questions and get instant, relevant answersâ€”saving time and boosting productivity.

<h1> Problem Being Solved </h1>
<h3> The RAG model is built to help: </h3>
<ul> 
 <li>IB students quickly find key concepts, definitions, and explanations from large PDF files </li>
 <li>Educators and tutors retrieve accurate info from syllabi and IB guides </li>
 <li>Anyone working with long, academic PDFs that are too time-consuming to search manually</li>
</ul>

<h1> Features </h1>
<ul> 
 <li>Question-answering over PDFs using LLM + vector store </li>
 <li>Chunking of long documents for optimized search </li>
 <li>Fast semantic retrieval with embeddinGS</li>
 <li> Customizable for any subject or PDF</li>
</ul>

<h1> Setup Instructions (From Scratch) </h1>
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install markdown depenendies with: 

```python
pip install "unstructured[md]"
```

## Create database

Create the Chroma DB.

```python
python create_database.py
```

## Query the database

Query the Chroma DB.

```python
python query_data.py "How does Alice meet the Mad Hatter?"
```

> You'll also need to set up an OpenAI account (and set the OpenAI key in your environment variable) for this to work.
