<h1> RAG Model for Efficient PDF Information Retrieval </h1>
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to extract and answer questions from long PDF documents, specifically targeted at helping students and educators quickly sift through dense International Baccalaureate (IB) material. Instead of spending hours skimming through IB study guides, past papers, or handbooks, this tool lets you ask natural-language questions and get instant, relevant answers—saving time and boosting productivity.

<h1> Problem Being Solved </h1>
The RAG model is built to help: 
<ul> 
 <li>IB students quickly find key concepts, definitions, and explanations from large PDF files </li>
 <li>Educators and tutors retrieve accurate info from syllabi and IB guides </li>
 <li>Anyone working with long, academic PDFs that are too time-consuming to search manually</li>
</ul>

<h1> Features </h1>
<ul> 
 <li>Question-answering over PDFs using LLM + vector store </li>
 <li>Chunking of long documents for optimized search </li>
 <li>Fast semantic retrieval with embeddinGS</li>
 <li> Customizable for any subject or PDF</li>
</ul>
